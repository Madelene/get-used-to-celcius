# Getting used to Celcius

After moving to the UK, I noticed that there weren't any apps that displayed the temperature in both Celcius and Fahrenheit. 

This is a simple Flask app (written in Python) to display the temperature in Bristol, UK, in both C and F, simultaneously.

To run the app, locally:
`$ flask --app weather run`
